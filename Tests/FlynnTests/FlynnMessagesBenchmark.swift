        // Note: this test/benchmark was ported directly from the Pony language
        // benchmark message-ubench.  Comments kept in as-is.

        // A microbenchmark for measuring message passing rates in the Pony runtime.
        //
        // This microbenchmark executes a sequence of intervals.  During an interval,
        // 1 second long by default, the SyncLeader actor sends an initial
        // set of ping messages to a static set of Pinger actors.  When a Pinger
        // actor receives a ping() message, the Pinger will randomly choose
        // another Pinger to forward the ping() message.  This technique limits
        // the total number of messages "in flight" in the runtime to avoid
        // causing unnecessary memory consumption & overhead by the Pony runtime.
        //
        // This small program has several intended uses:
        //
        // * Demonstrate use of three types of actors in a Pony program: a timer,
        //   a SyncLeader, and many Pinger actors.
        //
        // * As a stress test for Pony runtime development, for example, finding
        //   deadlocks caused by experiments in the "Generalized runtime
        //   backpressure" work in pull request
        //   https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2264
        //
        // * As a stress test for measuring message send & receive overhead for
        //   experiments in the "Add DTrace probes for all message push and pop
        //   operations" work in pull request
        //   https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2295
